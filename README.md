# Online-Game-using-HTML-JavaScript-CSS
An exquisite melange of HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create a game that involves the user entering a single digit number to kick start it into action, and trying to then select this number from a list of randomly presented numbers on the screen, updated every second. For every time the user presses on the number entered by him/her as at the start of the game, he/she scores a point. If the user happens to press a number different from this specific number, he loses a point. No click receives no point. The number entered by the user at the start of the game is displayed on the screen, alongside the score which is updated in real time as the user plays the game. The user can further choose to stop the game at any point in time and start it up again, choosing to enter a different number this time if he/she wills.
