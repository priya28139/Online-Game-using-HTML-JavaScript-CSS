# Online-Game-using-HTML-JavaScript-CSS
An exquisite melange of HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create a game that involves the user entering a single digit number to kick start the game, and trying to then select this number from a list of randomly presented numbers. For every time the user presses on the number entered by him/her (as at the start of the game), he/she scores a point. If the user happens to press a number different from this specific number, he loses a point. No click receives no point. The score is updated in real time on the screen for the reference of the user. The user can also stop the game at any point in time and start it up again, choosing to enter a different number if he/she wills.
